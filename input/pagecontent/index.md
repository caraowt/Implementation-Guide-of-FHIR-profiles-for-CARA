### Background

The CARA Association was formed in 2018. It comprises the cantons of Geneva, Valais, Vaud, Fribourg and Jura.

Through this alliance, the cantons are joining forces to offer digital health services to healthcare providers and the population of Western Switzerland.

The Association is working to expand its range of services, including a shared care plan and a shared medication plan.

The Shared Care Plan is a care plan defined at a given time for a given patient, by an interprofessional team of which the patient is a member according to his or her wishes. 

This care plan has its own characteristics:
- users with access to the PSP: members of the interprofessional team
- content: reasons for care, objectives and observations, clinical parameters and other notes

### Meet Shorty

This is Shorty, the mascot for FHIR Shorthand. He's doing contortions to shape himself into an "S", for Shorthand.
